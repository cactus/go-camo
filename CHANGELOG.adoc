== HEAD

== v2.2.2 - 2021-08-21
*   Change test only helper library
*   structure logging (json) support for http requests (debug logging). +
    PR #52

== v2.2.1 - 2021-03-25
*   Update some dependencies.

== v2.2.0 - 2021-01-10
*   Move ip filtering to Dialer.Control, to further improve SSRF protections. +
    Note: Added a few additional debug log messages emitted when ip filtering

== v2.1.5 - 2020-08-11
*   Rebuild release with go-1.15

== v2.1.4 - 2020-02-18
*   Rebuild release with go-1.13.8
*   Experimental windows build

== v2.1.3 - 2019-12-18
*   Rebuild release with go-1.13.5

== v2.1.2 - 2019-11-17
*   Fix for enabling metrics collection in proxy

== v2.1.1 - 2019-11-12

*   Security fixes / content-type validation
*   Add `ProxyFromEnvironment` support. This uses HTTP proxies directed by the
    `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` (or `http_proxy` and `no_proxy`) environment
    variables. See {link-proxy-from-env} for more info.

== v2.1.0 - 2019-10-02

*   Support `audio/*` with `--allow-content-audio` flag (similar to how video
    is handled)
*   Additional metrics datapoints when using `--metrics`
*   Support only go 1.13, due to use of new error wrapping semantics
*   Improve client connection early abort handling
*   Improve max response side handling -- only read MaxSize KB from any
    upstream server. Note: This may result in partial responses to clients for
    chunked encoding requests that are longer than MaxSize, as there is no way
    to signal the client other than closing the connection.
*   Change default of `--max-size` to 0, as previously chunked encoding
    responses bypassed size restrictions (only content-length was previously
    enforced). To avoid unexpected failures (preserve backwards compatibility
    in this regard), set max-size to 0 by default moving forward. Previous
    default was 5mb (use `--max-size=5120` to set to previous default).

== v2.0.1 - 2019-09-12

*   Slightly optimize some structure layouts to reduce memory overhead.
*   Switch htrie node map from uint8 to uint32, due to go map optimizations.
    See commit bbf7b9ffee83 for more info.
*   Update man page generation (makefile) to use asciidoctor.
    Not only is this easier to maintain, but it has the nice property of being
    rendered on github.

== v2.0.0 - 2019-09-08

*   Remove `--allow-list` flag, and replace with a unified filtering flag
    `filter-ruleset`. See link:man/go-camo-filtering.5.adoc[go-camo-filtering(5)]
    for more information on the accepted syntax.
*   Update man pages.
*   Refactor some internals (remove some regex in favor of a trie like data
    structure for some comparisons)

== v1.1.7 - 2019-08-14

*   Remove old stats flag, endpoint, and feature, in favor of the new
    Prometheus endpoint. Good amount of code removal as well.
*   Use a sync.Pool []byte buffer for io.CopyBuffer (instead of io.Copy). It
    should reduce some small amount of GC pressure (a bit less garbage).

== v1.1.6 - 2019-07-26

*   Support range requests to get safari video support working (#36)

== v1.1.5 - 2019-07-23

*   Security fixes / SSRF
**  Fix: Ensure non-GET/HEAD request does not send outbound request (#35)
**  Fix: Validate redirect urls the same as initial urls (#35)
*   Split out exception for missing content types (#32)
*   Prometheus compatible metrics endpoint added (#34)
*   Disabled credential/userinfo (`user:pass@` style) type urls by default.
    Added cli flag (`--allow-credential-urls`) to retain prior behavior (which
    allows them).

== v1.1.4 - 2019-02-26

*   disable passing/generating x-forwarded-for header by default
*   add new `--enable-xfwd4` flag to enable x-forwarded-for header
    passing/generation
*   add optional json output for stats
*   remove gomaxprocs code, as it is no longer necessary
*   documentation fixes (man page update, spelling, etc)
*   build release with go-1.12

== v1.1.3 - 2018-09-15

*   switch to go-1.11 w/GO111MODULE support. +
    this makes building outside GOPATH easy. +
    Looks like heroku supports it now too? (heroku-buildpack-go issue #249)
*   build release with go-1.11
*   fix ipv6 length comparison

== v1.1.2 - 2018-07-30

*   fix SSRF leak, where certain requests would not match defined and custom ip
    deny-lists as expected

== v1.1.1 - 2018-07-18

*   change `/healthcheck` response to 200 instead of 204. +
    solves configuration issue with some loadbalancers.

== v1.1.0 - 2018-07-16

*   add flag to allow `video/*` as content type (disabled by default)
*   allow setting custom server name
*   add flag to expose the current version version in http response header
    (similar to how it is done for `-V` cli output)
*   change root route to return 404
*   add `/healthcheck` route that returns 204 status (no body content)
    useful for load balancers to check that service is running

*   rebuild with go-1.8
*   strip binaries as part of default build

== v1.0.14 - 2017-02-15

    body closing
