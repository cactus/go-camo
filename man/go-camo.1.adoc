== NAME

go-camo - Go version of Camo server

== SYNOPSIS

*go-camo* [_OPTION_ [_OPTION-ARGUMENT_]]...

== DESCRIPTION

go-camo(1) is an implementation of Camo in Go.

Camo is a special type of image proxy that proxies non-secure images over
SSL/TLS. This prevents mixed content warnings on secure pages.

It works in conjunction with back-end code to rewrite image URLs and sign them
with an HMAC.

== ENVIRONMENT VARS

*GOCAMO_HMAC*::
    The HMAC key to use.

*HTTPS_PROXY*::
+
--
Configure an outbound proxy. Either a complete URL or a `host[:port]`, in
which case the __http__ scheme is assumed.

It will be used as the proxy URL for HTTPS requests.
--

*HTTP_PROXY*::
+
--
Configure an outbound proxy. Either a complete URL or a `host[:port]`, in
which case the __http__ scheme is assumed.

It will be used as the proxy URL for HTTP requests.
--

[NOTE]
.On Environmen Vars vs OPTIONS precedence
====
_OPTIONS_, if provided, override those defined in environment variables.

For exmaple, if the HMAC key is provided on the command line, it will override
(if present), an HMAC key set in the environment var.
====

== OPTIONS

*-k*, *--key*=<__HMAC_KEY__>::
   The HMAC key to use.

*-H*, *--header*=<__HEADER__>::
+
--
Add additional header to each response.
This option can be used multiple times to add multiple headers.
When specified, these headers are set unconditionally on all responses.

See __<<ADD_HEADERS>>__ for more info.
--

*--listen*=<__ADDRESS:PORT__>::
    Address and port to listen to, as a string of _ADDRESS:PORT_. +
    Default: `0.0.0.0:8080`

*--socket-listen*=<__SOCKET_PATH__>::
    Path for unix domain socket to bind to for HTTP.

*--ssl-listen*=<__ADDRESS:PORT__>::
    Address and port to listen via SSL to, as a string of _ADDRESS:PORT_.

*--ssl-key*=<__SSL-KEY-FILE__>::
    Path to ssl private key. +
    Default: `key.pem`

*--ssl-cert*=<__SSL-CERT-FILE__>::
    Path to ssl certificate. +
    Default: `cert.pem`

*--quic*::
    Enable http3/quic. Binds to the same port number as _--ssl-listen_ but udp+quic.

*--automaxprocs*::
    Set GOMAXPROCS automatically to match Linux container CPU quota/limits.

*--max-size*=<__SIZE__>::
    Max response size allowed in KB. Set to `0` to disable size restriction. +
    Default: `0`

*--timeout*=<__TIME__>::
    Timeout value for upstream response. Format is "4s" where s means seconds. +
    Default: `4s`

*--max-redirects*::
    Maximum number of redirects to follow. +
    Default: `3`

*--metrics*::
+
--
Enable Prometheus compatible metrics endpoint.

If the `metrics` flag is provided, then the service will expose a Prometheus
`/metrics` endpoint and a `/debug/vars` endpoint from the go `expvar` package.

See __<<METRICS>>__ for more info.
--

*--no-debug-vars*::
+
--
If the `no-debug-vars` flag is provided along with the `metrics` flag, the
`/debug/vars` endpoint is removed.

See __<<METRICS>>__ for more info.
--

*--no-log-ts*::
    Do not add a timestamp to logging output.

*--no-fk*::
    Disable frontend http keep-alive support.

*--no-bk*::
    Disable backend http keep-alive support.

*--log-json*::
    Log in JSON format.

*--allow-content-video*::
    Additionally allow `video/*` content type.

*--allow-content-audio*::
    Additionally allow `audio/*` content type.

*--allow-credential-urls*::
    Allow urls to contain user/pass credentials.

*--filter-ruleset*=<__FILE__>::
+
--
Path to a text file that contains a list (one per line) filter rules.

If an filter-ruleset file is defined, that file is read and each line
converted into a filter rule. If the request fails the rule-set, the
request is denied.

See <<go-camo-filtering.5.adoc#,go-camo-filtering(5)>> for more information.
--

*--server-name*=<__SERVER-NAME__>::
    Value to use for the HTTP server field. +
    Default: `go-camo`

*--expose-server-version*::
    Include the server version in the HTTP server response header.

*--enable-xfwd4*::
    Enable x-forwarded-for passthrough/generation.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
    Show verbose (debug) level log output

*-V*, *--version*::
    Print version and exit; specify twice to show license information.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Show help output and exit.


== ADD_HEADERS

Additional default headers (headers sent on every reply) can be set with the
*-H, --header* flag. This option can be used multiple times.

The list of default headers sent are:

----
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'
----

Additional headers are added to the above set.

As an example, if you wanted to return an Strict-Transport-Security and an
X-Frame-Options header by default, you could add this to the command line:

----
go-camo -k BEEFBEEFBEEF \
    -H "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=16070400" \
    -H "X-Frame-Options: deny"
----

== METRICS

When the *--metrics* flag is used, the service will expose a
Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint. This can be used by monitoring
systems to gather data.

The endpoint includes all of the default `go_` and `process_`. In addition, a
number of custom metrics.

A `/debug/vars` endpoint is also included with *--metrics* by default.
This endpoint returns memstats and some additional data. This endpoint can be
disabled by additionally supplying the *--no-debug-vars* flag.

.Exposed Camo Metrics
[%header,cols="<m,<,<.^6"]
|===
| Metric | Type | Description

| camo_response_duration_seconds | Histogram |
A histogram of latencies for proxy responses.

| camo_response_size_bytes | Histogram |
A histogram of sizes for proxy responses.

| camo_proxy_content_length_exceeded_total | Counter |
The number of requests where the content length was exceeded.

| camo_proxy_reponses_failed_total | Counter |
The number of responses that failed to send to the client.

| camo_proxy_reponses_truncated_total | Counter |
The number of responess that were too large to send.

| camo_responses_total | Counter |
Total HTTP requests processed by the go-camo, excluding scrapes.
|===

It also includes a `camo_build_info` metric that exposes the version. In addition, you can expose some extra data to metrics via env vars, if desired:

*   Revision via `APP_INFO_REVISION`
*   Branch via `APP_INFO_BRANCH`
*   BuildDate via `APP_INFO_BUILD_DATE`
*   You can also override the version by setting `APP_INFO_VERSION`

== EXAMPLES

Listen on loopback port 8080 with a upstream timeout of 6 seconds:

----
go-camo -k BEEFBEEFBEEF \
    --listen=127.0.0.1:8080 \
    --timeout=6s
----

Set HMAC key via env var, and an HSTS header:

----
export GOCAMO_HMAC=BEEFBEEFBEEF
go-camo \
    --listen=127.0.0.1:8080 \
    --timeout=6s \
    -H "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=16070400"
