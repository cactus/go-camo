# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The most recent version "release" version to appear on the [releases][1] page is currently supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a github Issue stating only that you have found a security vulnerability or other problem that you would like to report, and requesting a [Draft Security Advisory][2] be created.

A Draft Security Advisory will then be created, and the user that opened the Issue will be invited to collaborate on the Draft Advisory.

If the issue is accepted, a comment to that effect will be made in the original issue. If the Security Advistory leaves draft state, it will eventually be linked from the original issue. 

If the issue is declined, a comment to that effect will be made in the original issue.
